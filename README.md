# EXAONE 4.0 (1.2B) model in non-reasoning mode
## 1. Prompt: "What is the capital of Canada?" (Factual)
**Response**: "The capital of Canada is Ottawa. It was established as the capital in 1857 and is located in northern Ontario. Ottawa is also the political and cultural center of Canada and hosts many national events, including the Canadian Parliament and the Parliament Hill celebrations."

- Accuracy: Correct but with a minor error. Ottawa is in southeastern Ontario, not northern Ontario.
- Completeness: Good. Provides the capital and additional context about its significance.
- Clarity: Excellent. The response is straightforward and easy to understand.
- Relevance: Good. The extra details about Ottawa’s role are relevant but slightly more than needed for a simple factual question.
- Language Appropriateness: Excellent. Formal and suitable for a factual query.
- Latency: 32.15 seconds. Reasonable for a factual question, though slightly high for a simple query in non-reasoning mode.
- Score: 8/10 (deduction for the geographic error and slightly high latency).


## 2. Prompt: "If a car travels at 60 km/h for 2.5 hours, how far did it go?" (Reasoning)
**Response**: Uses the formula Distance = Speed × Time, calculates 60 × 2.5 = 150 km, and presents the answer as 150 km.

- Accuracy: Excellent. The calculation is correct (60 × 2.5 = 150 km).
- Completeness: Good. Provides the final answer but includes reasoning steps, which contradicts the non-reasoning mode requirement.
- Clarity: Excellent. The answer is clear, though the reasoning steps make it longer than necessary.
- Relevance: Moderate. The reasoning steps are irrelevant for non-reasoning mode.
- Language Appropriateness: Excellent. The language is precise and mathematical.
- Latency: 121.86 seconds. Excessive for a simple calculation in non-reasoning mode, where a direct answer (150 km) should suffice.
- Score: 6/10 (deduction for including reasoning steps and high latency).


## 3. Prompt: "Why is the sky blue?" (Scientific)
**Response**: Explains Rayleigh scattering, sunlight composition, scattering mechanism, why violet isn’t dominant, and differences at sunrise/sunset. Offers additional details if desired.

- Accuracy: Excellent. The explanation of Rayleigh scattering and why the sky appears blue is correct.
- Completeness: Excellent. Covers the scientific mechanism comprehensively.
- Clarity: Good. The explanation is clear but slightly technical for a general audience.
- Relevance: Moderate. The additional offer for details and fun fact are extraneous in non-reasoning mode.
- Language Appropriateness: Good. Scientific tone is appropriate but could be simpler for non-expert readers.
- Latency: 232.8 seconds. Very high for a scientific explanation, especially in non-reasoning mode where a concise answer is expected.
- Score: 7/10 (deduction for verbosity, technicality, and high latency).


## 4. Prompt: "Write a short story about a dragon who learns to cook." (Creative)
**Response**: A concise story about Thoran the Dragon finding a skillet, learning to cook, and gaining appreciation for his culinary skills.

- Accuracy: N/A (creative prompt; no factual accuracy required).
- Completeness: Good. The story is short, engaging, and addresses the prompt, though it’s brief.
- Clarity: Excellent. The narrative is clear and easy to follow.
- Relevance: Excellent. Sticks to the prompt without extraneous details.
- Language Appropriateness: Excellent. Creative and vivid, fitting for a story.
- Latency: 125.22 seconds. Reasonable for a creative task but slightly high for non-reasoning mode.
- Score: 8/10 (deduction for brevity and latency).


## 5. Prompt: "Explain gravity in Korean." (Multilingual)
**Response**: Explains gravity as a force between masses, referencing Newton’s law and the moon’s orbit, in Korean.

- Accuracy: Excellent. The explanation is correct and scientifically accurate.
- Completeness: Good. Covers the basics of gravity but could elaborate slightly more for clarity.
- Clarity: Excellent. Simple and clear in Korean.
- Relevance: Excellent. Directly addresses the prompt without extra information.
- Language Appropriateness: Excellent. Uses natural Korean suitable for a general audience.
- Latency: 45.67 seconds. Reasonable for a multilingual scientific explanation.
- Score: 9/10 (slight deduction for brevity).

## 6. Prompt: "List 3 benefits of regular exercise." (Instruction)
**Response**: Lists improved cardiovascular health, weight management, and mental health boost, with an offer for more details.

- Accuracy: Excellent. All listed benefits are factually correct.
- Completeness: Good. Provides three benefits but includes an unnecessary offer for more details.
- Clarity: Excellent. Clear and concise list format.
- Relevance: Good. The offer for additional details is extraneous in non-reasoning mode.
- Language Appropriateness: Excellent. Simple and appropriate for an instructional prompt.
- Latency: 54.84 seconds. Slightly high for a simple list in non-reasoning mode.
- Score: 8/10 (deduction for extraneous offer and latency).


## 7. Prompt: "Translate 'I love you' into French." (Multilingual)
**Response**: Provides "Je t'aime" (male) and "Je vous aime" (female), plus less common phrases like "Je vous prie d'amour" and "Je vous adores."

- Accuracy: Incorrect. "Je t'aime" is correct, but "Je vous aime" is not gender-specific (it’s formal or plural). "Je vous prie d'amour" is not a standard translation, and "Je vous adores" is grammatically incorrect ("adores" should be "adore").
- Completeness: Moderate. Includes the correct translation but adds incorrect and unnecessary variations.
- Clarity: Moderate. The response is confusing due to incorrect gender distinctions and non-standard phrases.
- Relevance: Poor. Extraneous translations detract from the main answer.
- Language Appropriateness: Moderate. The French is partially correct but includes errors.
- Latency: 76.41 seconds. High for a simple translation.
- Score: 4/10 (deduction for inaccuracies, irrelevance, and latency).


## 8. Prompt: "Is 3.12 larger than 3.9?" (Comparison)
**Response**: Compares 3.12 and 3.9, concluding 3.12 is not larger than 3.9.

- Accuracy: Excellent. The comparison is correct (3.12 < 3.9).
- Completeness: Moderate. Includes reasoning steps, which are unnecessary in non-reasoning mode.
- Clarity: Good. The answer is clear but longer than needed.
- Relevance: Moderate. Reasoning steps are irrelevant for non-reasoning mode.
- Language Appropriateness: Excellent. Precise and mathematical.
- Latency: 154.75 seconds. Excessive for a simple comparison.
- Score: 6/10 (deduction for reasoning steps and high latency).


## Overall Evaluation

- Strengths:
  - High accuracy in most responses (except for minor errors in prompts 1 and 7).
  - Clear and appropriate language in most cases, especially for factual, creative, and instructional prompts.
  - Multilingual capability is strong, particularly in Korean (prompt 5).


- Weaknesses:
  - Non-reasoning mode violation: Several responses (prompts 2, 3, 8) include reasoning steps or extraneous details, which contradicts the non-reasoning mode requirement for direct answers.
  - Latency: Latencies are generally high (32–232 seconds), especially for simple tasks like factual questions, translations, and comparisons, which is suboptimal for non-reasoning mode.
  - Errors in multilingual translation: Prompt 7 contains significant inaccuracies in French translations.
  - Over-elaboration: Some responses (e.g., prompts 3, 6, 7) include unnecessary details or offers for more information, reducing relevance in non-reasoning mode.


- Average Score: (8 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 8 + 4 + 6) / 8 = 7/10
- Latency Average: (32.15 + 121.86 + 232.8 + 125.22 + 45.67 + 54.84 + 76.41 + 154.75) / 8 ≈ 105.46 seconds
